Blood Bank App Icon Instructions
===============================

Since we can't generate PNG directly with basic Dart, here are your options:

1. ONLINE ICON GENERATOR (Recommended):
   - Go to: https://appicon.co/
   - Upload any square image (1024x1024 recommended)
   - Download the generated icon set
   - Replace the files in assets/icons/

2. MANUAL ICON CREATION:
   - Create a 1024x1024 PNG image
   - Red background (#D32F2F)
   - White medical cross in center
   - Save as: assets/icons/bloodbank_icon.png

3. USE EXISTING ICON:
   - The current icon at assets/icons/bloodbank_icon.png is very small (254 bytes)
   - Replace it with a proper 1024x1024 PNG

4. FLUTTER LAUNCHER ICONS:
   - Run: flutter pub get
   - Run: flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
   - This will generate all required sizes

Current Configuration:
- Icon path: assets/icons/bloodbank_icon.png
- Android: launcher_icon
- iOS: true
- Web: true (background: #D32F2F)
- Windows: true (size: 256)
- macOS: true

After creating/replacing the icon, run:
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
